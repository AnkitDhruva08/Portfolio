# Quick Start - Portfolio Theme System

## What's New

Your portfolio now has **10 professional themes** - 5 dark and 5 light!

## How to Switch Themes

1. **Desktop**: Click the "Themes" button in the navigation bar
2. **Mobile**: Open the mobile menu and find the theme switcher
3. Select any theme from the dropdown - your choice is automatically saved!

## Theme List

**Dark Themes:**
- Midnight Sophistication (Navy & Gold) - Default
- Ocean Depths (Teal & Coral)
- Forest Night (Green & Amber)
- Royal Purple (Purple & Rose Gold)
- Charcoal Elite (Gray & Electric Blue)

**Light Themes:**
- Cream Elegance (Cream & Navy)
- Sage Serenity (Green & Brown)
- Blush Professional (Pink & Rose)
- Sky Blue (Blue & Orange)
- Warm Beige (Beige & Burgundy)

## Currently Updated Components

The theme system is functional with:
- ✅ Navigation with theme switcher
- ✅ Hero section with dynamic colors
- ✅ Back to top button
- ✅ Theme persistence (saves your choice)

## Notes

Some components (About, Work, Skills, Experience, Contact, Footer) are still using the default Midnight Sophistication color palette. To make them theme-aware, they need to be updated to use the `useTheme()` hook. See THEME_GUIDE.md for details.

The core functionality works perfectly - you can switch themes and see the changes in the navigation, hero section, and overall page background!
